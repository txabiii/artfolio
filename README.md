# Txabi's Artfolio

Welcome to my Artfolio website's code! I made this using **Next.js 13** App directory, **SCSS** for styling, and an **Express.js**  for the backend.

Here, I showcase my cute art I made as well as a mock e-commerce website to show my chops as an aspiring web developer. My goal for this project is to both showcase my artworks as well as develop my web development skills.

## Notable Features

* Project Gallery
* Contact Form
* Catalog of Items
* Product details page
* Cart System
* Checkout System

## Artfolio Side

The Artfolio section of my website is dedicated to showcasing my  cute and anime-inspired art. Visitors can **browse my art pieces** and see my creative abilities and artistic vision. There is also a functionality for the user to **share and download** the artwork.

## E-Commerce Side

The Ecommerce side of my website presents a mock online shop featuring a variety of products adorned with my art. Visitors can browse an assortment of merchandise, including notebooks, mugs, banners, and pillows, all proudly displaying my artwork. The Ecommerce functionality allows users to **add items to their cart, proceed to the checkout page, and simulate the experience of purchasing products**. Although this is a mock shop, it demonstrates my ability to create an engaging and visually appealing online shopping experience.

## Deployment

The website is deployed [here](https://artfolio-wiky.vercel.app/) at Vercel for you to browse my art or assess my web development skills. Enjoy!

## Created by
